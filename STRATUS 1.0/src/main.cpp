 * STRATUS 1.0

 * Last year, I first attempted to make a car, but it was a
 * self-driving one that avoids obstacles, or, at least that
 * was what it was meant to do. It was a big fail! The motor
 * driver that I used was inefficient. The motors and other
 * components would fall out of the chassis. The code was
 * awful and messy (I was too lazy to use comments then.
 * But now, I know better and I would use them whenever
 * necessary, like how I am utilizing them now). The servo
 * motor that controls the Ultrasonic Sensor would get stuck
 * occassionaly. I did not know then that a regular 9V
 * battery would have insufficient current to supply enough
 * power to two DC motors. I was just so frustated! However,
 * I have learned from my mistakes and I am willing to not
 * give up on this one.
 * This is for my little sister.

 * Written By: Leslie Diane A. Monzon
 *
 * Receives and decodes IR signals sent by a joystick remote
 * then maps these signals to varying intensity and direction
 * of 4 DC Motors controlled using DRV8833.
 *
 * With RB Lighting (no G because ran out of PWM pins ðŸ˜£)
 *
 * ********************************************************
 * This is one of my very first few (working (hopefully))
 * programs, so I am not that good yet.
 * ********************************************************
 * The name STRATUS is a cloud's name. I think it is the
 * lowest cloud. No, I think the lowest cloud is named
 * Nimbus, but, it's just too scary and dark so I used
 * Stratus instead which is the second lowest cloud (I think).
 * So anyway, I named the car STRATUS because I am expecting
 * to make other stuff as well, like something that can fly
 * which I will name CUMULUS, then a rocket which I will
 * name CIRRUS. See the pattern? Cumulus clouds are higher
 * than Stratus clouds, and Cirrus clouds are higher than
 * Cumulus clouds. By the same idea, NOCTILUS can be the
 * name of a vehicle that travels beyond the Solar Sytem,
 * and NEBULUS travels beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Maybe,
 * just maybe, maybe it can maybe transport humans to another
 * habitable planet, maybe. Maybe, it may be!
